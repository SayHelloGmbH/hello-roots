## System requirements

### Composer

PHP dependencies (but not WordPress dependencies like plugins) are loaded using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Use `composer install` when first starting work on the theme, and `composer update` thereafter.

### NodeJS

`node` and node package manager `npm` are required to run the build commands.

Please visit [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the latest LTS version of nodeJS.

# Automation: Gulp

This theme comes with some very handy gulp tasks to make your life much easier.

You can install the packages using `npm install`.
```
$ cd path/to/your/project/
$ npm install
```
Afterwards you can use the following command to start the default gulp tasks.
```
$ npm start
```

## Feature overview

### Content width

WordPress loads content at an appropriate size - e.g. responsive images or external video embeds - using the `$content_width` variable. This should be modified for your project based on the standard width of a content element in the single blog post view. The definition is in the `Theme` class and can either be modified directly or via the filter `sht/content_width`.

### settings.json

There are shared settings between CSS and JavaScript files which are stored inside `assets/settings.json`. You can import them into any JavaScript module (`import * as settings from '../../../../../assets/settings.json';`) or use them inside any scss file (for example: `$my_easing_speed: $easing_speed;`).

### Styles

This theme uses an [ITCSS architecture](https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528) together with the [BEM naming convention](http://getbem.com/). All `.build/assets/styles/*.scss` files will be converted to inside `assets/styles/{$name}.css` files.

The Package Class `Assets` enqueues them directly.

- admin-editor.min.css is loaded in the backend. This file is generated from _.build/assets/styles/admin-editor.scss_.
- admin.min.css is loaded in the backend. This file is generated from _.build/assets/styles/admin.scss_.
- ui.min.css is loaded in the backend. This file is generated from _.build/assets/styles/ui.scss_.

#### CSS Variables

The CSS will be generated with [CSS Variables](https://dev.to/sarah_chima/an-introduction-to-css-variables-cmj) in the generated stylesheets. The (JavaScript-based) Ponyfill `css-vars-ponyfill` ([source](https://github.com/jhildenbiddle/css-vars-ponyfill)) is included for IE11 support in the frontend. (_Not_ in the admin area!.)

#### Gutenberg Blocks

The Theme is provided with built-in SCSS support for Gutenberg blocks. There is a specific `Gutenberg` Package for some functionality.

The SCSS variable `$block-mode` is defined in _admin-editor.scss_ and _ui.scss_ appropriate to each context, so that the mixins `blocks-frontend` and `blocks-backend` can generate the CSS appropriately for the current context. For example:

```scss
.wp-block-image {
	vertical-align: middle;
}
@include blocks-frontend() {
	.wp-block-image {
		margin-top: 1rem;
		margin-bottom: 1rem;
	}
}
```

**Note** that the call to `@include blocks-frontend()` may not be defined _within_ the `.wp-block-image` definition, but must be included as a separate section due to the CSS namespacing which occurs in the `gulp-editor-styles` process.

#### gulp-editor-styles

Gulp uses the [gulp-editor-styles](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-editor-styles) Node Module to automatically parse and wrap the CSS in an appropriate scope (`.editor-styles-wrapper`) for the Gutenberg editor.

### Scripts

This theme uses ES6 modules which are converted to ES5 using Babel and bundled using Webpack. The Package Class `Assets` enqueues the resultant fidirectly. For example: all `.build/assets/scripts/ui/*.js` files will be bundled to `assets/scripts/ui.js`. There will also be a minified version `assets/scripts/ui.min.js`.


### Fonts

There is a built in Font loading process using base64 encoded woff/woff2 fonts, which are stored inside the local storage of the browser. This avoids the FOUT problem.

Assuming that the fonts you're using are licensed for use in this way, convert the fonts to base64-encoded WOFF and WOFF2 CSS files using [Transfonter](https://transfonter.org/) and then add the code to the files in the [assets/fonts](https://github.com/SayHelloGmbH/hello-roots/tree/master/assets/fonts) folder.

These files are then loaded [by JavaScript](https://github.com/SayHelloGmbH/hello-roots/blob/master/src/Package/Assets.php#L124) and stored in the browser's [LocalStorage](https://javascript.info/localstorage). The script checks the asset version number; if you need to force a new version of the files, then update the [`theme_fontver`](https://github.com/SayHelloGmbH/hello-roots/blob/master/assets/settings.json#L38) in the Assets' JSON configuration file.

### LiveReload

It also uses [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) to refresh your browser on every change you make.

If you are using Google Chrome there is a pretty helpful extension: [chrome LiveReload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei)
