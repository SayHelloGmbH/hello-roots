## Feature overview

### Content width

WordPress loads content at an appropriate size - e.g. responsive images or external video embeds - using the `$content_width` variable. This should be modified for your project based on the standard width of a content element in the single blog post view. The definition is in the `Theme` class and can either be modified directly or via the filter `sht/content_width`.

### settings.json

There are shared settings between css and js Files which are stored inside `assets/settings.json`. You can import them into any js module (`import * as settings from '../../../../../assets/settings.json';`) or use them inside any scss file (for example: `$my_easing_speed: $easing_speed;`).

### Styles

This theme uses an [ITCSS architecture](https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528) together with the [BEM naming convention](http://getbem.com/). All `.build/assets/styles/*.scss`-Files will be converted to inside `assets/styles/{$name}.css`-Files.  

The Class `classes/class-themeassets.php` enqueues them directly.

### Scripts

This theme uses es6 modules which are converted to es5 using babel and bundled using webpack. For example: All `.build/assets/scripts/ui/*.js`-Files will be bundled to `assets/scripts/ui.js`. There will also be a minified version `assets/scripts/ui.min.js`.

The Class `classes/class-themeassets.php` enqueues them directly.

### Fonts

There is a built in Font loading process using base64 encoded woff/woff2 fonts, which are stored inside the local storage of the browser. You can read more here: [https://github.com/SayHelloGmbH/hello-roots/tree/master/.build/assets/fonts](https://github.com/SayHelloGmbH/hello-roots/tree/master/.build/assets/fonts)

### LiveReload

It also uses [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) to refresh your browser on every change you make.  

If you are using Google Chrome there is a pretty helpful extension: [chrome LiveReload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei)
